# Kalko: (Kal)kulator+(ko)nversi

Kalko is a command-line based calculator with unit conversion feature. Kalko is short for "KALkulator" and "KOnversi" which means calculator + conversion. The conversion feature is a unit conversion such as *kilogram*(kg) to *gram*(g), *mile* to *kilometer*(km), etc.
